2. cd azure-sdk-for-python
3. python setup.py install
4. To create a Service Principal, run the following command in azure cli and save the output in a file named "auth.json"
        az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "MY-PRINCIPAL-NAME" --password "STRONG-SECRET-PASSWORD"

5. Run ConnectAzure_authentication.py file.
6. Run create_vm_azure.py file and provide the inputs asked.
7. Check in the azure portal to see the new resource group and its components created.
